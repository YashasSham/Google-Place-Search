Google Place Search with voice command feature

[1]This is a simple client side code. So it should be fairly easy to start 
Launch the Application by simply clicking index.html
 
[2]Please run this on Mozilla or Google chrome browser only. And Internet is must
Speach recognition uses HTML5 which may not be supported by all browsers.
 
[3]After your voice commands, wait for a second for the change to reflect.
 
[4]I have not yet integrated the text-to-speech synthesiser hence, there is no way of replying to you if browser doesn't understand you.
		so if you said "Next" and the voice recognition heard it as "Nest", your command won't work.

[5]Try to speak clearly, repeat twice. If not happening use 'mouse pointer'. 

[6]If you are unable to access google API's. Then that could be because of API key error.

	API key = "AIzaSyBcw21n_zy_3BNDr23FPubz-wNvllzReNw"
	"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=API_KEY&libraries=places&callback=initAutocomplete"
	Paste this in:
		<script src="HERE" async defer></script> of SecondPage.HTML

[7] Further instruction on starting the application.
NOTE: This is not a perfect system, but an application under development. Please wait for further updates on github. If you find any bugs, please let me know.
